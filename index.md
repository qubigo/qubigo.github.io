# Game rules

The game is played on a cube with 27 positions.
Players take turns placing a piece in one of these positions.
The objective of the game is to create a series of 3 pieces with one or more
common characteristics in a row, in any direction.

    <img src="images/3-in-row-pic2.png?0.3.3" alt="">
    <img src="images/3-in-row-pic3.png?0.3.3" alt="">
</div>

Start with an empty cube and all pieces in the bag. 

Each player takes out a number of pieces and places them on the table, visible
for the opponent.

Pioneers and kids: take 1 piece each. 

Advanced players: take 5 pieces each. 

Master level: take 13 pieces each, place the remaining piece on a random
position in the cube.

Turn by turn, place a piece in any of the three layers of the cube. After each
move pick a new piece from the bag. Note the score on paper or download app for
score keeping.

The game continues until all positions on the cube are filled; the player with
the most points wins.


# Scoring

The pieces come in 3 shapes, 3 colors, and 3 structures.

If a player creates a series of 3 pieces with a common characteristic in a row,
they earn a point.
