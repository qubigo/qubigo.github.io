Players must develop a 3D strategy while preventing their friends from scoring
points. With just 27 moves to victory, Qubigo is a game that requires a sharp
mind and calculated risk-taking.

The desktop game is now for sale in 2 versions, made in Amsterdam by our founders Rob and Anton.

# Setting up

Gently lift the cube out of the box - it's packaged with all the pieces.
![take the cube out](images/manual/1-get-out.png)
Turn the magnetic box 90 degrees - it's now a shaker!
![twist the box](images/manual/2-turn.png)
Pour all the 27 pieces from the cube into the shaker.
![fill the shaker](images/manual/3-fill.png)
Shake out 3 pieces per player and place them in front of you.

To make the game more challenging, you can make more than three pieces visible to all players. The more pieces you see, the more strategic it gets. Ultimate challenge: make all pieces visible.

# Game rules


## Objective

Be the player who scores the most points by lining up three pieces that share a common feature in any direction. Pieces come in 3 structures: solid, open and ribbed

    </div>
</div>

## Gameplay

1. Players take turns making a move.
2. Place one of your pieces in an open position in any layer in the cube.
3. Click the three layers togetherby turning the logos in the middle in the same direction.

1. After placing a piece, shake out a new one so you always have three visible.
5. Record your points with the score card and score pieces. Game ends when the cube is full. 

## Scoring

A row with **one** shared feature gives 1 point.  
For example:

<div class="doc-example">
    <div class="image-row">
        <img src="images/pieces/2d/pyramid_open_yellow.png?0.3.3" class="piece" alt="">
        <img src="images/pieces/2d/sphere_stripe_yellow.png?0.3.3" class="piece" alt="">
        <img src="images/pieces/2d/cube_solid_yellow.png?0.3.3" class="piece" alt="">
    </div>
    <div class="image-row">
        <img src="images/pieces/2d/cube_stripe_green.png?0.3.3" class="piece" alt="">
        <img src="images/pieces/2d/cube_solid_red.png?0.3.3" class="piece" alt="">
        <img src="images/pieces/2d/cube_open_yellow.png?0.3.3" class="piece" alt="">
    </div>
</div>
<div class="doc-example">
    <div class="image-row">
        <img src="images/pieces/2d/pyramid_solid_red.png?0.3.3" class="piece" alt="">
        <img src="images/pieces/2d/cube_solid_green.png?0.3.3" class="piece" alt="">
        <img src="images/pieces/2d/sphere_solid_green.png?0.3.3" class="piece" alt="">
    </div>
    <div class="image-row">
        <img src="images/pieces/2d/pyramid_open_green.png?0.3.3" class="piece" alt="">
        <img src="images/pieces/2d/cube_open_red.png?0.3.3" class="piece" alt="">
        <img src="images/pieces/2d/sphere_open_yellow.png?0.3.3" class="piece" alt="">
    </div>
</div>

A row with **two** shared features gives two points.  
For example:

<div class="doc-example">
    <div class="image-row pieces">
        <img src="images/pieces/2d/cube_solid_yellow.png?0.3.3" class="piece" alt="">
        <img src="images/pieces/2d/cube_solid_green.png?0.3.3" class="piece" alt="">
        <img src="images/pieces/2d/cube_solid_red.png?0.3.3" class="piece" alt="">
    </div>
    <div class="image-row">
        <img src="images/pieces/2d/pyramid_stripe_green.png?0.3.3" class="piece" alt="">
        <img src="images/pieces/2d/cube_stripe_green.png?0.3.3" class="piece" alt="">
        <img src="images/pieces/2d/sphere_stripe_green.png?0.3.3" class="piece" alt="">
    </div>
</div>
<div class="doc-example">
    <div class="image-row">
        <img src="images/pieces/2d/pyramid_open_yellow.png?0.3.3" class="piece" alt="">
        <img src="images/pieces/2d/pyramid_open_red.png?0.3.3" class="piece" alt="">
        <img src="images/pieces/2d/pyramid_open_green.png?0.3.3" class="piece" alt="">
    </div>
    <div class="image-row">
